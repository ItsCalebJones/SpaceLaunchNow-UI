# GitHub Actions & Cypress Integration Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Cypress testing issues in the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Issue Fixed

The primary issue was:

```
Error: Timed out waiting for: http://localhost:3000
```

This occurred because Cypress was attempting to run tests before the React development server was fully initialized and ready to accept connections.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Package Dependencies & Tools

- Added `wait-until` package for better async handling in Cypress
- Updated GitHub Actions to the latest versions
- Created custom wait and retry utilities

### 2. Enhanced Configuration

- Modified `cypress.json` with increased timeouts:
  ```json
  {
    "pageLoadTimeout": 120000,
    "defaultCommandTimeout": 10000
  }
  ```
- Updated the `start-server-and-test` command with longer timeout:
  ```json
  "ci:e2e": "start-server-and-test --startTimeout 60000 start-silent http://localhost:3000 cypress:run"
  ```

### 3. Added Cypress Custom Command

- Created a custom `waitUntil` command in Cypress for more reliable waiting
- Added it to the support files so it's available in all tests

### 4. Created a More Resilient Test Runner Script

- Added a Node.js script (`scripts/wait-for-server.js`) that:
  - Starts the development server
  - Actively polls until the server is ready
  - Only runs tests when the server is confirmed to be working
  - Has configurable retry logic and timeouts

### 5. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows

- Switched to using the official Cypress GitHub Action which has better handling for server startup:
  ```yaml
  - name: Run Cypress tests
    uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
    with:
      start: npm start
      wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
      wait-on-timeout: 120
      browser: chrome
      record: false
  ```
- Added caching for Cypress binary to speed up CI

### 6. Added Documentation

- Created a troubleshooting guide for Cypress timeout issues
- Updated the workflow files with comments

## How to Use

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Normal testing flow (now with increased timeouts)
npm run ci:e2e

# More resilient testing with the custom script
npm run ci:e2e:reliable
```

The GitHub Actions workflows now handle this automatically and should be more reliable.

## Future Improvements

Consider:
- Adding retry logic for flaky tests
- Setting up monitoring for test performance
- Creating a dedicated test environment in CI
