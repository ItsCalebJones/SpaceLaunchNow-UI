 * The Launch Library API is a product by The Space Devs with an up-to-date database of Spaceflight events. 

While this API is free to use it is subject to rate limiting for non-authenticated requests.

Please use https://lldev.thespacedevs.com for development testing - the development endpoint has stale data but is not subject to any rate limits.

If you are interested in a higher rate limit please consider supporting the project on Patreon for access to an API Key.
